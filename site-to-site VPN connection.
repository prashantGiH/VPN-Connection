STEPS:-  Task:- Site-to-Site VPN connection using Openswan Package Install.

         6) Create 2 Instance for Public and private instance, select AMI Linux 2.
         7) Select instances and edit inbound Rule of All ICMP-IPV4 select and save rule.
         8) Create customer gateway --> Name:- customer-gateway
                                        IP Address:- Public IP of pub-instance
         9) Create virtual private gateway --> Name:- VPG-private
                                               Amazon default ASN
        10) Select VPG --> Action --> Attach to VPC-A
        11) Site-to-Site VPN connection Open :- Create VPN Connection -->
                                                 Name:- vpn
                                                 VPG:- select our created VPG.
                                                 customer gateway:- select our created CG.
                                                 Routing Option:- Static
                                                 Static IP prefix:- 172.25.0.0/16
                                                 Create VPN connection.

                          auth=esp --> delete this line
                          leftsubnet= CIDR Client(public IP) [172.25.0.0/16]
                          rightsubnet=CIDR Aws(private IP) [10.10.0.0/16]

                      # ping Private IP of Pvt-instance
                      # ping private IP of pub-instance

        Ping Successfully, Hence the traffic is flow into Tunnel 1 is done. and also VPN site to site connection is done.
